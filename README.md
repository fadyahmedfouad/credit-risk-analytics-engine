# Credit Risk Analytics Engine

## Overview
This project implements a credit risk analytics engine with:

- Basel III compliance (LCR & NSFR)
- Monte Carlo simulation
- Stress testing
- ML explainability (SHAP & LIME)
- Regulatory reporting templates (EBA/ECB style)
- Interactive analytics

The project uses synthetic data and is designed for learning and portfolio demonstration.
